## 📖 About
The Christmas Lights application is a mesmerizing light display.
This app consists of placing seven colored circles
in a row and based on a stopwatch, change the light intensity of each circle. When
a circle is illuminated, its predecessor returns to its normal intensity.

This simulates the effect of a string of rippling lights, similar to the ones
displayed during the Christmas Holidays.
